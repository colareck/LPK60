## Keyboard design

The keyboard is designed to use QMK firmware (still working on my commit for the QMK repo) with an STM32F072CBT6 microcontroller. The board should accept both v1 and v2 choc switches, it is importnat to note that with the current version the esc,tab, 1, and Q keys will need the plastic posts trimmed if using v1 switches. This was a design flaw that will be corrected in the next verison. MBK keycaps fit well, but I have not tested other keycaps. Currently, the only place I have sourced the 6.25u spacebar is from a custom order at fkcaps.com.
